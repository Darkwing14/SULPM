# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to SULPM! The project is currently small, so the easiest way to help is to add packages, fix bugs, or improve documentation. Below are guidelines to make contributions smooth and consistent.

## Code of Conduct
Please follow the project's Code of Conduct (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions and contributions.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repository and create a descriptive branch (e.g., `feature/add-foo-package` or `fix/issue-123`).
2. Make your changes in your branch. For adding packages, put new package folders under `packages/` (or a similarly named directory) with a README and any metadata files required by the project.
3. Write tests where applicable and make sure existing tests pass.
4. Run linters / formatters (we recommend using `black` and `flake8` for Python projects).
5. Commit changes with clear messages. If you use DCO or a sign-off policy, include a `Signed-off-by:` line in your commit message.
6. Push your branch and open a pull request explaining the change and any testing performed.

## Issues and feature requests
- Before opening a new issue, search existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Provide a clear title, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and relevant logs or screenshots.

## Security
Do NOT add malware, explicit illegal instructions, or content intended to enable wrongdoing. If you discover a security vulnerability, please disclose it privately to the repository owner rather than creating a public issue.

## Style and testing
- Follow Python best practices (PEP 8). Use `black` to format code.
- Add or update tests and document how to run them in the repository README.

## Licensing
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the repository's license. If a contributor license or DCO is required, sign or sign-off as directed.

## Thank you
Thanks for helping improve SULPM â€” contributions of any size are appreciated!
