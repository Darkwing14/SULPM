# Code of Conduct

Welcome — thank you for contributing to SULPM. This Code of Conduct sets expectations for participation and explains how rule violations are handled.

## Rules

1. **No gore**  
   - Do not include graphic gore. Keep content appropriate for younger audiences — an 8-year-old could conceivably download a package. Non-graphic educational references to blood are allowed (for example, in biology or history contexts).

2. **No 18+ / explicit adult content**  
   - Explicit sexual content, pornographic material, or other adult-only content is prohibited. If you are unsure whether content is 18+, avoid including it. Breaking this rule will result in being blacklisted.

3. **No tutorials or instructions for committing crimes**  
   - Do not add content that teaches or facilitates illegal activity.

4. **Licensing**  
   - All projects and packages contributed to this repository must be licensed under the MIT License. You may include your name or authorship information in packages, but contributions are expected to be shareable and reusable under MIT terms.

4.5. **If you want to have your own liscense**
   - If you wish to have your own liscense, you will have to make your own github repository for SULPM, you can be found with: sulpm package username repositoryname. If you do this on your own repo, you may have any liscense you want and only have to obey U.S. Law (Including copyright of other people's things.) instead of these clauses.

5. **Be respectful**  
   - Be kind and respectful in interactions and content. Keep profanity to a minimum: limit swearing to in-game contexts only and avoid using more than one swear word per sentence.

6. **No malware**  
   - Malware of the following kinds is explicitly disallowed and will result in an immediate blacklist: crypto miners, viruses, worms, trojans, remote access trojans (RATs), and blackmail/extortion software.

7. **No blackmail**  
   - Attempts to blackmail the maintainer to include a project will result in immediate rejection and blacklisting.

8. **Obey the copyright law**
   - We ask that all copyright laws in your country are being followed. This applies to 4.5 too.

## Enforcement

- Violations may lead to commit rejection, removal of the content, and addition to a project blacklist. Blacklisting is enforced at the maintainer's discretion; if a contributor is blacklisted, future contributions will be rejected even if they later comply with the rules.

## Reporting

- To report a policy violation or to appeal a decision, please contact the repository owner via their GitHub profile (https://github.com/Darkwing14) or open an issue clearly labeled "code-of-conduct". For suspected security vulnerabilities, consider disclosing privately as described in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Thank you for helping keep SULPM safe, legal, and welcoming for users of all ages.
